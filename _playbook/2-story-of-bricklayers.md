### Story of Bricklayers
*#facetoface #virtual* 

Ease your participants into your expectations for their conduct in your program with a story about bricklayers. You can tell it as it is shown below or spruce it up with more details from your imagination.

A reporter visited some construction sites where he met bricklayers who told different accounts about their jobs in his interview. At each construction site, the reporter would ask, 'Would you care to share about what you're building here?'

"I am laying bricks to build a wall,” came the brusque reply from the first bricklayer.

“I am building part of an office,” said the second bricklayer dismissively.

The third bricklayer, noted the reporter, seemed different from the other two who he spoke with earlier.

He responded to the reporter with a twinkle in his eyes, 'I am building a beautiful skyscraper.'

The third bricklayer left the reporter with insights about his work in the construction industry, and so the reporter left with much satisfaction to work on his story.

At the end of the story, you should have a discussion with your participants to frame their views about participating in your program with questions such as, “What are your expectations of the program?” or “What do you hope to achieve from this workshop?” This is to encourage them to begin the program positively with an end in mind (The 7 habits of highly effective people, Stephen Covey).
