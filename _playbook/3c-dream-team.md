### Dream Team 
*#facetoface #virtual #preprogram*

Ask participants about what they envision a learning session to be like if it were to be organised by their dream team. For instance, you may ask ‘What would you like your first hour of training to be like?’ Then, you may design your program according to the preferences described by your participants.

This idea is inspired by the Qualtrics’ Dream Team. Click [here](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/qualtrics-dream-team-bringing-events-back-individual-kortney-osborne/) to read more.

At times it can be difficult to get your participants to submit tasks before a workshop begins because they are busy with completing their work before attending your program. In this case, you can instead do this as a check-in conversation with your participants in the first 10-15 minutes when your session begins. This allows you to get some ideas on how you can make little adjustments to suit your participants' learning preferences. Concurrently, it would also be encouraging for your participants to know that you care about their preferences, so this can prime them to participate actively in your workshop.
