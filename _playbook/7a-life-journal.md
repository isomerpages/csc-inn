### Life Journal 
*#facetoface #virtual #preprogram #mainprogram #postprogram*

Life Journal is about drawing a visual timeline of your life's significant events and sharing them with your team. This presents an opportunity for learners to share emotional connections as they appreciate other aspects of their lives apart from their professional careers. 

It is highly recommended to allow ample wait time of approximately 15 minutes for participants to reflect deeply while they attempt to draw their Life Journal. 

For participants who feel that they are less artistically inclined, they may try sketching an [emotional graph](/playbook/storytelling/emotional-graph/) instead.
