| **Suggested Time:**   | 15 minutes          |
| **Difficulty Level:** | Easy                |
| **Mode:**             | Online, synchronous |
| **Tools Needed:**     | Spotify (Premium)   |
| **Program Phase:**    | Main Programme      |

Before your programme begins, have a check-in conversation with your participants about the songs they love. This can help them in building a sense of community as they discover each other's tastes in music.  Then, create a Spotify playlist based on their song requests and play it during breaks. It would be really handy to have a colleague assist you with this while you engage your participants.  
  
#### Instructions  
Here's how you can share music with your participants if you're running a training programme on Zoom:

  2. Locate **Share computer sound** at the bottom of the pop-up window. Make sure that it is checked so that Zoom will broadcast the audio playing from your computer.

  3. Select the **Spotify app** from the pop-up window and click **Share**.

  In this example, the window containing the Spotify web player is selected. This will be useful for instances where agency issued devices are not authorised to download Spotify.
