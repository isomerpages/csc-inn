### Object Share
*#virtual #facetoface #postprogram*

Like a [show & tell](/playbook/presentations/show-and-tell/), this is about sharing how objects personify us and represent our thoughts and ideas.  

Each person brings in an object whose characteristics resonate with an idea that she wants to share for reflection. For instance, in a discussion that is part of the Emerging Stronger Conversation, a participant may present a stone which reflects his hopes that the strong foundation laid by Singapore's policies will help all Singaporeans tide through the recession. 

This activity can be more fun when conducted in a virtual program, assuming that participants are joining your program from their homes. They would have easy access to personal items that hold more meaning for them, so this can help to create rich conversations for the reflection segment.
