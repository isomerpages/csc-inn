If you're thinking of making your presentations look professional and stylish, look no further. You can now spice up your virtual learning programs with videos superimposed on static or animated backgrounds. This can be achieved with [Veescope Live Greenscreen](http://www.dvdxdv.com/NewFolderLookSite/VeeScope/iOS/) which is available for Apple users to download from the App Store. Alternatively, you can use the [Open Broadcaster Software (OBS)](https://obsproject.com/) is available for free to download and it is being used by content creators for video recording and live streaming on platforms such as YouTube and Twitch. Options for superimposed video editing are not limited to just these two platforms as we are constantly experimenting with various options.  

At INN x CSC, we provide the hardware you need, so you need not worry about buying additional equipment for filming. You get access to a green room which is equipped with studio lights, a green screen, and ample space for filming your presentation. After the filming is done, you can use the free Open Broadcasting Software (OBS) to edit your videos.

You're welcome to have a chat with our friendly nINNjas on how to use the green room for your program's video production.
