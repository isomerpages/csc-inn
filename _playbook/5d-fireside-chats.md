### Fireside Chats
*#facetoface #mainprogram*

#### What is a fireside chat?  
A fireside chat is a casual alternative to the [press conference](/playbook/presentations/press-conference/) presentation method. It is an informal yet structured interview between a moderator and speaker. In context of a training workshop, the trainer will have to play the role of moderator to direct conversations to revolve around the workshop's learning outcomes. She may engage participants individually or in groups. 

#### How to facilitate a fireside chat? 
Since fireside chats are meant to be casual and intimate, you may consider arranging seats in the horseshoe style. The absence of tables in this format creates a sense of barrier-free interaction between the speaker(s) and his audience. To encourage transparency, the audience are seated facing inward so that they can see each other. 

The unique trait of a fireside chat is that it engages the audience by involving everyone. You can use online tools such as [Mentimeter](https://www.mentimeter.com/) or [Slido](https://www.sli.do/?utm_expid=.FbC-m0r6TqGUijIDcS_rOw.0&utm_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sli.do%2Ffeatures-questions%3Futm_source%3Dblog%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_campaign%3Dwhy-how-fireside-chats%26utm_content%3Dslido-1) to invite members of the audience to share their questions or insights. These inputs can help conversations to flow naturally so that it is less stressful for the presenter(s). 

Once your participants feel comfortable enough during their presentation, you may prompt them to share their personal backstories and insights that are relevant to the presentation topic. This is another key to making presentations enjoyable as people tend to be engaged by stories. When there is positive affect, there can be better retention of learning.
