*Players in a Piing.Events game while on Zoom.*

To set up a game, you only need your computer to be connected to a big screen in your classroom and players will use their smartphones as controllers. For a virtual program run on Zoom, you can project the game's screen on Zoom's **Share Screen** feature. 

The price plans for each game are not revealed on [Piing.Events](https://piing.events/) but you can email them to enquire.
