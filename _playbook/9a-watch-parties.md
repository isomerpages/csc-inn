### Watch Parties 
*#virtual #preprogram #mainprogram*

<br/>  

Since safe distancing measures have kicked in to combat the Covid-19 pandemic, we have been highly discouraged from going out for movies with friends. Fortunately, the growing variety of titles on various online streaming services means that we can still enjoy sharing a show together while being physically apart. Thanks to ubiquitous video conference apps like Zoom, MS Teams and Discord, meeting friends online for virtual watch parties has become hassle free.  

Virtual watch parties can be useful for teambuilding. You can use short videos for a watch party session taking place during lunch break, or movie and full-length documentaries for an entire afternoon dedicated to teambuilding. A set of reflection questions would be useful for engaging your participants in thoughtful conversations as they relive the emotions and ideas that they would encounter in a show. 

#### How to Use Zoom for Watch Parties  
Zoom is probably the easiest option to use for this activity as it requires only one person with a premium account to host a watch party. Do note that if you're using the free Zoom account, you have 40 minutes before your session times out. 

Here's how you can play the host.  
   1. Prepare your video of choice and start a meeting.  
   2. Click **'share screen'** and select the window that has your video in it.  
   3. Make sure that the checkboxes for **'share computer sound'** and **'optimize screen sharing for video clip'** have been checked. Then, click **'share'**.  
   
#### The Good and the Bad  
Zoom participants can share their reactions to a video by typing in the chat box. This means that comments can be exchanged almost instantaneously while the video is playing, though it can be a little distracting. This can be helpful for them to immediately jot down some key details that can be used for a discussion later. 

However, a major downside of streaming videos on Zoom is that the picture quality isn't always great. The video resolution will be adjusted to suit the bandwidth for streaming. This means that you might be looking at highly pixellated images which are a huge dampener for a watch party. On the same note, the lackadaisical streaming quality also means that the audio may not play in sync with the video.
