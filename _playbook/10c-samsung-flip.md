### Samsung Flip
*#facetoface #mainprogram*

The Samsung Flip is an interactive digital flip chart that's set to transform modern day meetings. Unlike powerpoint slides, Samsung flip offers a kinesthetic feel in presenting information as users can manipulate information with annotations, sync their presentations across a variety of devices (laptops, tablets, smartphones, etc.), and share notes seamlessly via email.
