### Body Parts 
*#facetoface #virtual #postprogram*

This reflection activity can be done with stress balls shaped as body parts to help learners think better with movements or tactile sensations. Each body part represents a different aspect of reflection like this: 

   * **Heart:** Describe something you felt, or a feeling you experienced.  
   * **Brain:** Talk to the group about a piece of content knowledge that you have learned.  
   * **Stomach:** What took guts for you to do, or pushed you outside of your comfort zone?  
   * **Hand:** How has the group supported you? How would you like to lend a hand to this cause based on what was just shared?  
   * **Ear:** Describe something you heard and explain how it has challenged your beliefs.  
   * **Eye:** Describe a vision you had for the group, or something you saw.  
   * **Smiley Face:** Tell the group something that made you smile. Describe some positive attributes about yourself or the group.  

This activity can still be carried out without the stress balls as props. Simply label the different body parts on separate pieces of paper and assign them to learners for reflection.

If you plan to carry out this activity for a virtual program, simply prepare a diagram to show how the different body parts symbolize the various ways of reflecting.
