### Avatars
*#virtual #preprogram*

<br>
Avatars can help participants in receiving feedback from a third partyâ€™s perspective. As avatars mask their true identities, participants may feel safe about giving feedback to each other. You may also consider printing their avatars on their certificates at the end of a program as a form of personalised gift.

#### Create an avatar on Facebook 

If participants already have Facebook accounts, they can easily create their avatars there. Watch this video to find out how it can be done.

You may also read the written instructions for this in Cnet's article [Make a Facebook avatar for chat, Instagram, Twitter and more](https://www.cnet.com/how-to/make-a-facebook-avatar-for-chat-instagram-twitter-and-more-heres-how/). 

To use the Facebook avatar that you've created, simply tap on the smiley face icon in the 'Write a Comment' section as you would normally do when inserting emojis, then apply your Facebook avatar sticker. Your Facebook avatar will also be available as a sticker in social media apps such as Twitter, Snapchat and Instagram. You can also download your Facebook avatar as a photo to be used for other purposes apart from these social media platforms. 

#### Create an avatar on Bitmoji 

Alternatively, you can also create avatars on Bitmoji. You can download the Bitmoji app for free on Google Play or the App Store, or download the Google Chrome extension if you prefer to work on your desktop/laptop. 

View the video below for a walkthrough on how to create your avatar on the Bitmoji for smartphones or read this [Bitmoji support article](https://support.bitmoji.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001493806-Create-Bitmoji-with-a-Selfie).

With your Bitmoji avatar created, you can save it as an image and attach it anywhere to be used as your profile picture. This can also be handy for trainers to customise Bitmoji classrooms on Google Slides with their avatars. 

#### Facebook avatars VS Bitmoji avatars

Facebook avatars and Bitmoji avatars are similar in art styles and sport full-body avatars. However, here are some key differences between for you to take note. 

  * Facebook avatars can only be created on the Facebook mobile app whereas Bitmoji avatars can be created on the Bitmoji mobile app and Google Chrome extension plugin for desktop users. 
  * Facebook avatars have fewer animation options than Bitmoji avatars. 
  * Facebook avatars are less customizable than Bitmoji avatars.
