### Laopeh Says 
*#virtual #preprogram #mainprogram*

[Laopeh Says](https://laopehsays.com/) is an online adaptation of the popular card game Cards Against Humanity. All you need for this game to work is a web browser and no login is required. Once you've created a game, simply **copy your game's link** over to your participants on Zoom. Alternatively, you can split your participants into breakout rooms. One member of each breakout room will have to create a game and share the link with their respective group mates. 

#### Playtime
15-30 minutes

#### Number of Players 
As with Cards Against Humanity, you need a minimum of 4 players to play this game. There is no limit to the number of players, but it is best played with 6-8 players as this allows a balance of having a variety of players' responses and fast-paced gameplay.  

#### How to Play 
1) At the start of a round, the Laopeh/Father chooses a card to play. Everyone will take turns being the Laopeh.  
2) Everyone but the Laopeh will then select a card to answer the Laopehâ€™s card.  
3) Once everyone has selected a card to play, Laopeh will look through all submitted cards and pick his/her favourite answer. The player whose card got chosen wins that round and gets a point.  
4) The game ends when a player reaches 10 points.
