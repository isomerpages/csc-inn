### Show and Tell
*#virtual #facetoface #preprogram #mainprogram #postprogram*

Show & tell is a tactile approach commonly used in schools to presenting ideas with unique artefacts and this also works well with adult learners.

Let's say you're conducting a workshop on design thinking and you instruct your participants to apply a design thinking framework to create a prototype solution using recycled materials. as they present prototypes of their work. Sharing about their work will help the audience to appreciate the meaning in what they do. It also helps to stoke innovation as people can get new ideas from seeing what others are working on. 

Show & tell can help to encourage participants to take greater ownership of their learning. Knowing that their work will be presented to people can motivate them to do it well and take pride in their work. It also fuels a positive culture of learning that grows in momentum as peers continue to exchange ideas.

Do check out the ideas listed in 'Presentations' to complement the show & tell technique.
