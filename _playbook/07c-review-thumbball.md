### Review Thumbball
*#facetoface #postprogram*

This is inspired by the End of Day Review Thumballâ„¢ designed to help trainers facilitate reflections meaningfully. Simply annotate every pentagon on a soccer ball with thoughtful questions about their experiences.

#### Preparation  
Try to use open-ended questions to encourage participants to elaborate on their responses. Here are some examples of open-ended questions:  
   * Describe a job well done by a teammate. How has it inspired you?  
   * Describe how you have learned to overcome your limitations.  
   * Describe how you have tapped on your strengths to contribute to your group's objectives.  

There are many more questions that you can create as conversation starters to facilitate conversations among participants. 

#### Execution  
Once you have prepared your Review Thumbball, have your participants pass the ball around with their group members in turns. The reflection questions are selected based on where their thumbs touch as they catch the ball. 

#### When to use  
For a full-day program, you may use this idea for a mid-day review and/or a end-of-the-day review. If your program takes place over a few days, you may consider having your participants pick one question for each day and spend 20 minutes on writing their reflections on a journal. You can host a reflections journal for participants on the discussions feature in Learn DC. 

With this idea, facilitators can pass the responsibility for consolidating learning into their participants' hands.
