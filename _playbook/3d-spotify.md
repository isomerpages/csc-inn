### Community Spotify
*#facetoface #virtual*

Create a Spotify playlist customised for your group of participants by asking them to submit their preferred songs by their favourite artistes. This is preferably done as a pre-program task so that you won't spend too much time on it during your main program. 

For face-to-face classes, simply launch the Spotify app on your computer and play the songs through a set of power speakers. Music can also be shared in virtual classes on Zoom. 

Here's how you can share music with your participants on Zoom: 

    1. Click Share Screen. 
    2. Locate Share computer sound at the bottom the dialogue box that appears. Make sure that it is checked so that Zoom will broadcast the audio playing from your computer. 
    3. Select the Spotify app from the dialogue box and click Share. 

You can play the songs before a session starts or during breaks to entertain your participants while they wait for your program to start. Participants may also feel appreciated about having a stake in your program by contributing to a community playlist to create a vibrant atmosphere for learning.
