### Light Cubes
*#facetoface #preprogram #mainprogram #postprogram*

When designing a workshop, learning content usually takes precedence as we seek to equip learners with essential knowledge and skills that they can apply at work. This often leads us to neglect key environmental design features that contribute to creating a more vibrant learning experience.

Here at INN, we have light cubes that are designed to set just the right atmosphere for an immersive learning experience. 
  * Blue lights such as those pictured above were used to create suspense in a simulation game. The participants were role-playing as characters with unique traits and they had to decide who to throw overboard their sinking raft.
  * These lights are also apt for lighting a room in a cool colour without detracting from a presentation. It also allows learners to write notes comfortably.
  * If you're considering having [fireside chats](/playbook/presentations/fireside-chats/) for presentations, you may use these light cubes to create warm ambient lighting for a cosy atmosphere. 
  * You can use lights to highlight areas designated for different activities. This helps to liven up the ambience without cluttering your workshop venue with signage. 

The possibilities in the use of INN's light cubes abound. Feel free to discuss your workshop's design considerations with our nINNjas if you feel inspired to use them!
