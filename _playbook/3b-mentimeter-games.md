### Mentimeter Games 
*#facetoface #virtual*

[Mentimeter](https://www.mentimeter.com/) offers a range of features that allow you to create simple activities to gamify your workshop. Possible uses of Mentimeter include quizzing participants to check their understanding of a previous lesson, eliciting prior knowledge and assumptions before teaching a lesson, or facilitating icebreaker sessions and many more.

You can make Mentimeter games relatable to participants by posting personal trivia quizzes. For instance, you can create a quiz for players to guess the identities of their peers' baby photos. 

Real-time input from your audience can be useful as conversation starters when facilitating an energizer activity. Apart from injecting an element of fun, gathering feedback this way might prove handy in making adjustments to your program's delivery.

To engage your participants in a Mentimeter game, simply direct them to [www.menti.com](www.menti.com) and share your presentation's **auto-generated menti code**.
