### Team Reflection Web 
*#facetoface #virtual #mainprogram #postprogram*  

<br/>
A team reflection web is a useful learning artefact that consolidates all participants' thoughts in one place. Participants can review the reflections of their peers to extend their learning after a day's program has ended. This technique is effective in presenting every participant's voice especially if you're facilitating in a large group setting and cannot afford time for everyone to share their reflections in a synchronous face-to-face session. 

The example in the image above was created using a free mindmap tool. You can also do this on other collaborative platforms recommended for ideation in this playbook such as [Miro](/playbook/ideation/miro/) and [Jamboard](/playbook/ideation/jamboard).
