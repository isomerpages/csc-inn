### Press Conference 
*#facetoface #mainprogram*  

Participants can host press conferences to enact role-playing scenarios in which they convey important information to their audience. Press conferences allow interactions in the form of question & answer sessions where panelists seek to address queries raised by their audience to elaborate on an issue. 

To make this a fruitful session, it is recommended that you prepare a template of question frames with some examples for your learners to think about how they can contribute to an in-depth exploration of ideas in the Q&A segment. You can use the 5W1H (who, what, where, why, when, how) question starters for instance. You may have to guide your participants towards asking open questions instead of closed questions because the latter tends to invite single-word or short factual answers that do not leave much room for discourse to take place. The key is to ask questions that can lead to new insights.
