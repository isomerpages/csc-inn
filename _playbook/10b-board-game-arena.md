Head to [Board Game Arena](https://en.boardgamearena.com/) for hundreds of board games that have been digitalized for online play. Players can explore their team dynamics through various modes of gameplay.  With old favourites like Saboteur (image below) and 7 Wonders, players are bound to have a roaring good time!

*Players in a game of Saboteur at Board Game Arena.*


Here are some key factors to note when selecting a digital board game: 

  * **Be familiar with the game's rules.**\
  You need to be able to deliver clear instructions to your participants so that they know how to play the game. You may have to do a visual demonstration of the gameplay while explaining the rules. This will save your players the pain of reading long lines of rules on the website so that they can have more time to enjoy the game. 


  * **Be mindful of the recommended duration for your selected game.**\
  Games that last no more than 30 minutes excluding facilitator's demo time are ideal for icebreaker activities. If you're dedicating a bigger segment of your program for teambuilding like a company cohesion event, you may consider games that require up to 1 hour for each playthrough. 

Once your participants are ready, you can assign them to **breakout rooms** on Zoom. You can move between breakout rooms to check in on participants and assist them with their queries about the game.
