[Miro](https://miro.com/) is a free online collaborative whiteboard for users to work together remotely. You can generate ideas on this digital platform and have them saved in a cloud system, so this makes it convenient for you to access your Miro notes wherever you go. Notes can be added easily by going to the **left panel** and clicking on the **sticky note** button. Each Miro has unlimited digital whitespace and can be easily converted into reports. 
  
There is limitles space on a Miro board for different sets of collaborative work to be integrated. View this video from Miro to find out more.

#### Create a Digital Gallery Walk 
You can present your ideation in a gallery walk using Miro in a virtual workshop. With the addition of basic shapes and text, you can create a presentation gallery for participants to share their work and post comments. This guide will take you through a simple process of creating a gallery for participants to upload files from their local hard drive. 

##### Step 1
![Click the shape button on the left panel to add basic shapes to create a placeholder for your gallery.](/images/miro gallery walk 1.png)

From the left panel, click the **shape** button to add basic shapes to create a placeholder for your gallery. This helps to set a clearly defined space on a limitless Miro board for your participants to add content to a gallery walk. 

##### Step 2
![The toolbar above your shape contains a 'set colour and opacity' button.](/images/miro gallery walk 2.JPG)

A toolbar will appear above your placeholder. Click the **set colour and opacity** button to modify the background colour for your gallery. 

##### Step 3
![Labelled columns within the main placeholder for each group of participants in your workshop.](/images/miro gallery walk 3.JPG)

Repeat steps 1-2 to create columns within your main placeholder according to the number of groups of participants in your workshop. You can also click on the **text** button to insert a text box to label each column with a title. 

You can also get creative with other basic shapes to create spaces for your gallery. For instance, the arrow shape can be used for a jigsaw gallery walk where participants contribute pieces of content to illustrate a process, while the heart shape can be used for an appreciation poster on which participants post messages of affirmation for frontline healthcare workers. 

##### Step 4
![Use the lock button in the toolbar above your inserted objects.](/images/miro gallery walk 3b lock button.JPG)

Once you're done with inserting and modifying the objects (shapes and text boxes) for your gallery template, select all of them together and click the **lock** button in the toolbar above them. This will help to fix the columns in place within the placeholder and prevent participants from making accidental changes to their placement and colours. Now you can also move the entire gallery template around your Miro board as a grouped object. 

Step 5 onward will be relevant for your participants in creating content for their gallery walk. 

##### Step 5: Upload participants' presentation object 
![Upload button on the left panel of your Miro board.](/images/miro gallery walk 4.JPG)

Click the **upload** button on the left panel and select **my device** from the expanded menu to upload your local file for your presentation. 

The **triple dot menu button** on the left panel will expand a list of other options for you to create additional content on your gallery. You can also embed a video, create a mindmap, or import images from Google search. 

##### Step 6: Resize and lock presentation object
![Resize your object and lock it within your allocated space.](/images/miro gallery walk 5 lock button.JPG)

Once your presentation object has been insert, you may **resize** it while placing it within the allocated space. Remember to use the **lock** button to fix its size and placement. You can do a **long press to unlock** if any further changes need to be made to your object.  

##### Step 7: Visiting 'booths' and leaving comments 
![Select sticky note from the left panel to leave comments while visiting 'booths'.](/images/miro gallery walk 6 stick note.JPG)

Visiting the different groups' booths in the gallery is a simple matter of clicking and dragging around the Miro board and zooming in on the presentation objects. You can leave constructive feedback for the presenters by clicking on the **sticky note** button on the left panel.

#### Other Project Ideas with Miro 
Here are additional ideas from Miro collaborator [Martina Crnkovic](https://community.miro.com/community-stories-60/using-miro-board-for-trainings-and-people-development-262) and Andrew Kow from CSC's Strategic Human Resource for you to explore.  

##### Summary of 3-day training course

One frame was created for each day's training program to consolidate key learning content. *Source: [Martina Crnkovic](https://community.miro.com/community-stories-60/using-miro-board-for-trainings-and-people-development-262)*

##### Training materials for different programs 
![Different frames to display training materials for different programs.](/images/miro martina3 different workshops.png)
This Miro board features different frames to display training materials for different programs. Participants can revisit the content that they have created in collaboration with each other and connect the different topics easily. *Source: [Martina Crnkovic](https://community.miro.com/community-stories-60/using-miro-board-for-trainings-and-people-development-262)*

##### Visual notes for process implementation
![A series of visual elements like infographics and an embedded video to illustrate processes.](/images/miro martina2 process implementation.png)
Visual elements such as infographics and an embedded video were integrated  together on this Miro board to illustrate how a process could be implemented, so there is no need for participants to view the content on a separate website. This is an effort to digitalize visual guides used in a face-to-face workshop. *Source: [Martina Crnkovic](https://community.miro.com/community-stories-60/using-miro-board-for-trainings-and-people-development-262)*
