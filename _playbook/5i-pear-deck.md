### Pear Deck for Google Slides 
*#virtual #facetoface #mainprogram*  
<br/>  
Presentations need not be a one-way monologue in the classroom anymore with [Pear Deck](https://www.peardeck.com/googleslides). With Pear Deck, you can create interactive presentations to engage your audience in constructing knowledge together. The Pear Deck Add-on for Google Slides enables you to insert formative assessments and interactive questions in your presentation and collate your audience's responses without the hassle of toggling between multiple windows like you would do in a conventional PowerPoint presentation. The interactive options include multiple choice, poll, open-ended response, and even draggable and drawing responses (*Premium only*).  

In this example, a Google slide was designed with Pear Deck's draggable response feature for participants to indicate their home locations on the MRT map. A facilitator would be able to see their responses being submitted in real-time so this makes the presentation a seamless experience.
