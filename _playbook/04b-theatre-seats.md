### Theatre Seats
*#facetoface #mainprogram*

Arrange seats in the theater style where seats are arranged in straight rows. This lets the audience face forward towards the classroom's front so that they can get the full impact of a speaker's message. You may consider using bean bag seats and couches to soften the look of the theater seating arrangement and create a casual and comfortable setting for participants to watch each otherâ€™s presentations.
