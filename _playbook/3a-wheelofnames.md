You have a full class of participants and you're asking for volunteers to share ideas, but no one is responding to you. The resulting awkward silence weighs down on you and dampens everyone's learning experience. With [Wheel of Names](https://wheelofnames.com/), you can call on participants at random and keep your lesson moving at a faster pace.   

#### Setup

You may also modify the animation after a spin, such as the text display that participants will see when a name gets selected.  
  
**Step 3:** Click **Save** if you wish to use the same setup for several sessions. You will need to sign in to do this.  
  
**Step 4:** Click on the wheel when you're ready to spin it.  
  
If you're running your program on Zoom, remember to show your Wheel of Names via Zoom's **Share Screen** feature when spinning the wheel.
