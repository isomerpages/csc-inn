### Miro 
*#virtual #facetoface #mainprogram*

<br/>
[Miro](https://miro.com/) is a free online collaborative whiteboard for users to work together remotely. While brainstorm sessions are conventionally done with post-it notes and whiteboards in a face-to-face setting, Miro allows users to generate ideas on a digital platform so their work can be saved in a cloud system. This also makes it easy for them to access their Miro notes wherever they go. Each Miro has unlimited digital whitespace space and it is also easy to convert your work into reports. 

#### Digital Gallery Walk 
Let's suppose you intend to have your participants present their ideation in a gallery walk, you can easily do this in Miro for a virtual workshop. Take a look at this template that our fellow nINNja Amanda created for a digital version of the National Game Scenario for the HR Leadership Program.

With the addition of basic shapes and text, you can create a presentation gallery for participants to share their work and post comments. In this example, rectangular columns have been designated as booths for six groups of participants to post their work. Visiting each booth is simply a matter of zooming in to view the contents and click-and-drag with the mouse to move to the next booth.

Click on the **triple dot menu button** on the left panel and you will see an expanded list of options for you to create additional content on your Miro board. Participants can embed a video, upload a file from their local hard drive, create a mindmap, or import images from Google search. For this brief walkthrough, we'll look at uploading a PowerPoint presentation file.

Once your PowerPoint file is uploaded, it may appear as a pinprick image on the Miro board. Locate it and drag it to the appropriate booth, then zoom in to view it and enlarge its size as you deem fit. Notice that there are **left and right navigational arrow buttons** in the toolbar just above the slide. They are meant for you to scroll through the deck of slides to view their contents. If you wish to leave a comment about the presentation, you can click on the **sticky note** button on the left panel.

#### Gamify Your Learning Experience

Apart from Miro's sticky note function for participants to share ideas in a brainstorm activity, there are addtional options available for you to create low-resolution prototypes to gamify learning experiences. The image featured above is a digital prototype of Nexus designed by Andrea Kow from Strategic Human Resource (SHR) for the HR Management Program (HRMP). 

Nexus is originally an analogue boardgame designed by the Dutch company Perspectivity to simulate the complexities of multiple stakeholders collaborating to manage resources in fulfilling their respective agenda. As with all boardgames, players have to share and exchange game tokens while playing the game. Andrea's prototype featured here is an attempt to digitalize the boardgame to meet the learning outcomes of HRMP whilst avoiding the sharing of physical game tokens among participants in compliance with social distancing regulations.  

The visual elements on this digital prototype are constructed from basic shapes and text which are added from the left panel, and icons are uploaded via the **Google images plugin** which is available in the left panel's **triple dot menu button**.  

Gamification features such as the Wheel of Names and Google's dice roller pictured below were integrated by adding hyperlinks to the texts 'Disaster Wheel' and 'Spin the dice'.

*Clicking on the hyperlinked texts 'Disaster Wheel' and 'Spin the dice' will direct players to the external sites of Wheel of Names and Google's dice roller respectively.*  

With a spark of ingenuity in integrating the use of the different options available in Miro, you can also create a prototype as an outcome of your ideation process.
