### Miro 
*#virtual #facetoface #mainprogram*

<br/>
[Miro](https://miro.com/) is a free online collaborative whiteboard for users to work together remotely. While brainstorm sessions are conventionally done with post-it notes and whiteboards in a face-to-face setting, Miro allows users to generate ideas on a digital platform so their work can be saved in a cloud system. This also makes it easy for them to access their Miro notes wherever they go. Each Miro has unlimited digital whitespace space and it is also easy to convert your work into reports.
