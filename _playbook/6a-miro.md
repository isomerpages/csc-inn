### Miro 
*#virtual #facetoface #mainprogram*

<br/>
[Miro](https://miro.com/) is a free online collaborative whiteboard for users to work together remotely. While brainstorm sessions are conventionally done with post-it notes and whiteboards in a face-to-face setting, Miro allows users to generate ideas on a digital platform so their work can be saved in a cloud system. This also makes it easy for them to access their Miro notes wherever they go. Each Miro has unlimited digital whitespace space and it is also easy to convert your work into reports. 

#### Digital Gallery Walk 
Let's suppose you intend to have your participants present their ideation in a gallery walk, you can easily do this in Miro for a virtual workshop. Take a look at this template that our fellow nINNja Amanda created for a digital version of the National Game Scenario for the HR Leadership Program.

With the addition of basic shapes and text, you can create a presentation gallery for participants to share their work and post comments. In this example, rectangular columns have been designated as booths for six groups of participants to post their work. Visiting each booth is simply a matter of zooming in to view the contents and click-and-drag with the mouse to move to the next booth.

Click on the triple dot button on the left panel and you will see an expanded list of options for you to create additional content on your Miro board. Participants can embed a video, upload a file from their local hard drive, create a mindmap, or import images from Google search. For this brief walkthrough, we'll look at uploading a PowerPoint presentation file.

Once your PowerPoint file is uploaded, it may appear as a pinprick image on the Miro board. Locate it and drag it to the appropriate booth, then zoom in to view it and enlarge its size as you deem fit. Notice that there are **left and right navigational arrow buttons** in the toolbar just above the slide. They are meant for you to scroll through the deck of slides to view their contents. If you wish to leave a comment about the presentation, you can click on the **sticky note** button on the left panel.
