*Here are the different templates available in Miro for use in ideation.*

<br/>
[Miro](https://miro.com/) is a free online collaborative whiteboard for users to work together remotely. You can generate ideas on this digital platform and have them saved in a cloud system, so this makes it convenient for you to access your Miro notes wherever you go. Notes can be added easily by going to the **left panel** and clicking on the **sticky note** button. Each Miro has unlimited digital whitespace and can be easily converted into reports. 

There is limitles space on a Miro board for different sets of collaborative work to be integrated. View this video from Miro to find out more.

#### Create a Digital Gallery Walk 
You can present your ideation in a gallery walk using Miro in a virtual workshop. With the addition of basic shapes and text, you can create a presentation gallery for participants to share their work and post comments. This guide will take you through a simple process of creating a gallery for participants to upload files from their local hard drive. 

##### Step 1
![Click the shape button on the left panel to add basic shapes to create a placeholder for your gallery.](/images/miro gallery walk 1.png)

From the left panel, click the **shape** button to add basic shapes to create a placeholder for your gallery. This helps to set a clearly defined space on a limitless Miro board for your participants to add content to a gallery walk. 

##### Step 2
![The toolbar above your shape contains a 'set colour and opacity' button.](/images/miro gallery walk 2.JPG)

A toolbar will appear above your placeholder. Click the **set colour and opacity** button to modify the background colour for your gallery. 

##### Step 3
![Labelled columns within the main placeholder for each group of participants in your workshop.](/images/miro gallery walk 3.JPG)

Repeat steps 1-2 to create columns within your main placeholder according to the number of groups of participants in your workshop. You can also click on the **text** button to insert a text box to label each column with a title. 

You can also get creative with other basic shapes to create spaces for your gallery. For instance, the arrow shape can be used for a jigsaw gallery walk where participants contribute pieces of content to illustrate a process, while the heart shape can be used for an appreciation poster on which participants post messages of affirmation for frontline healthcare workers. 

##### Step 4
![Use the lock button in the toolbar above your inserted objects.](/images/miro gallery walk 3b lock button.JPG)

Once you're done with inserting and modifying the objects (shapes and text boxes) for your gallery template, select all of them together and click the **lock** button in the toolbar above them. This will help to fix the columns in place within the placeholder and prevent participants from making accidental changes to their placement and colours. Now you can also move the entire gallery template around your Miro board as a grouped object. 

Step 5 onward will be relevant for your participants in creating content for their gallery walk. 

##### Step 5: Upload participants' presentation object 
![Upload button on the left panel of your Miro board.](/images/miro gallery walk 4.JPG)

Click the **upload** button on the left panel and select **my device** from the expanded menu to upload your local file for your presentation. 

The **triple dot menu button** on the left panel will expand a list of other options for you to create additional content on your gallery. You can also embed a video, create a mindmap, or import images from Google search. 

##### Step 6: Resize and lock presentation object
![Resize your object and lock it within your allocated space.](/images/miro gallery walk 5 lock button.JPG)

Once your presentation object has been insert, you may **resize** it while placing it within the allocated space. Remember to use the **lock** button to fix its size and placement. You can do a **long press to unlock** if any further changes need to be made to your object.  

##### Step 7: Visiting 'booths' and leaving comments 
![Select sticky note from the left panel to leave comments while visiting 'booths'.](/images/miro gallery walk 6 stick note.JPG)

Visiting the different groups' booths in the gallery is a simple matter of clicking and dragging around the Miro board and zooming in on the presentation objects. You can leave constructive feedback for the presenters by clicking on the **sticky note** button on the left panel.

#### Create a Low-Res Digital Prototype
![Experimental digital prototype of Perspectivity's boardgame Nexus designed to simulate multi-stakeholder collaboration in managing resources.](/images/miro nexus.JPG)  

Apart from Miro's sticky note function for participants to share ideas in a brainstorm activity, there are addtional options available for you to create low-resolution prototypes such as digital games to inject some fun in learning experiences. The image featured above is a digital prototype of Nexus designed by Andrea Kow from Strategic Human Resource (SHR) for the HR Management Program (HRMP). 

Nexus is originally an analogue boardgame designed by the Dutch company Perspectivity to simulate the complexities of multiple stakeholders collaborating to manage resources in fulfilling their respective agenda. As with all boardgames, players have to share and exchange game tokens while playing the game. Andrea's prototype is an attempt to digitalize the boardgame to meet the learning outcomes of HRMP whilst avoiding the sharing of physical game tokens among participants in compliance with safe distancing regulations.  

The visual elements on this digital prototype are constructed from **basic shapes** and **text** which are added from the left panel, and icons are uploaded via the **Google images plugin** which is available in the left panel's **triple dot menu button**.  

Gamification features such as the Wheel of Names (see this related [article](/playbook/energizers/wheelofnames/)) and Google's dice roller pictured below were integrated by **adding hyperlinks** to the texts 'Disaster Wheel' and 'Spin the dice'. 

![Clicking on the hyperlinked texts 'Disaster Wheel' and 'Spin the dice' will direct players to the external sites of Wheel of Names and Google's dice roller respectively.](/images/miro nexus gamification features.jpg)
*Clicking on the hyperlinked texts 'Disaster Wheel' and 'Spin the dice' will direct players to the external sites of Wheel of Names and Google's dice roller respectively.*  

With a spark of ingenuity in integrating the use of the different options available in Miro, you can also create a prototype as an outcome of your ideation process.
