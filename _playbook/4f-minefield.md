Minefield is typically played as a team building game in energizer segments of corporate events and school orientation programs. Here's how you can facilitate this game in a virtual setting. 

#### Playtime
Approximately 10 minutes. 

#### Tools Needed
* Zoom
  For participants and facilitators to communicate with each other. Use the show screen feature to share your instructions to the players. 

* Google Slide or PowerPoint
  Prepare a deck of slides that show your minefield, game rules and 10 challenges. Simply create a 6x4 table (image above) and plan your start and end points and hidden mines, then you're ready to launch your game. 
  
#### Challenges 
As a facilitator, you get to decide the types of challenges to post to your participants. They can be simple tasks such as: 
* Show 1 apple each. 
* List the names of MRT stations along the East-West line in the correct order. 
* Finish a can of coke in 30 seconds.

#### How to Play
1. Your team must complete a challenge (see below) to move a step across the minefield. Use Zoom's annotate function to indicate the tile that your team has decided to move into. Your facilitator will reveal if you have stepped onto a safe tile or a mine.  
2. If your team steps on a mine, go back to the starting point.  
3. You are not allowed to draw or annotate locations of mines on the minefield. You must depend solely on your memory to remember them.
