### Whose Fridge is This? 
*#virtual #facetoface #preprogram*

If we are what we eat, then our fridges reveal what we are like as well. This activity is an alternative to a [house tour](/playbook/energizers/house-tour/) where participants take a peek into each other's living spaces by viewing their fridges instead. To make things more exciting, participants guess the owner of a fridge based on its contents.  

To prepare for this game, you will need to ask participants for photos of their fridges and arrange them into a deck of slides so that you can easily share the pictures over Zoom's share screen feature. You might have to do this preparatory work before your workshop commences, or, if time permits, during lunch breaks.
