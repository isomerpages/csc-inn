### Emotional Graph
*#facetoface #virtual #preprogram #mainprogram #postprogram*

Sketch a line graph that illustrates changes in your moods or perceptions over time. The x-axis represents time while the y-axis represents a range of emotions. 

This is a good alternative for participants who aren't comfortable with drawing a [Life Journal](/playbook/storytelling/life-journal/). Both methods are useful for highlighting new discoveries or revelations. You can do this to share your life's stories or your changes in viewpoints throughout the course of a program.
