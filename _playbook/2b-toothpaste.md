Which part of a tube of toothpaste do you normally squeeze to get the most out of it? This activity is about getting participants to communicate and share different perspectives. For a program where examining different perspectives is key to their learning, you can use this activity to set an expectation on participants to listen to different opinions respectfully.    

---

**STEP 1**  

Show a picture of a tube of toothpaste, then elicit participants' responses about the part of the tube they would usually squeeze.  

Face-to-face mode: Affix the picture on a flipchart. Let participants display their choices by pasting post-it notes with their names.  

Virtual mode: Use **Zoom's share screen** feature to show the picture on a presentation slide. Let participants display their choices by using **Zoom's annotate** feature.

**STEP 2**  

Ask your participants to explain their reasons behind their preferences.  

Here are some common responses to expect :
* It is more efficient to squeeze from the bottom of the tube. You can get the most toothpaste out of the tube.
* Squeezing from the middle of the tube gets the toothpaste out faster.
* I have better control over the amount of toothpaste to extract if I squeeze the middle of the tube.
* Everything should have a proper start point. Squeezing the tube in the middle makes the it look messy, so I squeeze its bottom part.

**STEP 3**  

Relate this activity to the learning outcome about viewing different people's perspectives respectfully.
