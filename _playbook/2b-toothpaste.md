### Toothpaste 
*#facetoface #virtual*

Which part of a tube of toothpaste do you normally squeeze to get the most out of it? This activity is about getting participants to communicate and share different perspectives. 

First, draw a sketch of a tube of toothpaste a flipchart. Then, elicit their responses about which part of the tube they would usually squeeze. As expected you will find that different positions are preferred by different people. Next, ask your participants to account for their preferred methods.

Here are some common responses to expect :
* It is more efficient to squeeze from the bottom of the tube. You can get the most toothpaste out of the tube.
* Squeezing from the middle of the tube gets the toothpaste out faster.
* I have better control over the amount of toothpaste to extract if I squeeze the middle of the tube.
* Everything should have a proper start point. Squeezing the tube in the middle makes the it look messy, so I squeeze its bottom part.

For a program where examining different perspectives is key to their learning, you can use this activity to set an expectation on participants to listen to different opinions respectfully.
