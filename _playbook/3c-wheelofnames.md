### Wheel of Names 
*#facetoface #virtual*

You have a full class of participants and you're asking for volunteers to perform a task, but no one is responding to you. With [Wheel of Names](https://wheelofnames.com/), you can delegate tasks to participants at random and no one will fault you for being biased towards a select few participants. 

To ensure transparency with your participants during a virtual lesson on Zoom, simply show the Wheel of Names via Zoom's **Share Screen** feature when spinning the wheel.
