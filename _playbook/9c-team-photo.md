### Team Photo
*#virtual #postprogram*

With a spark of imagination, group photography that are typically done at the end of video conferences need not be boring with participants smiling blankly at their webcams. However, coordinating poses across multiple participants' frames in a video conference app's window can be vexing as the arrangement of frames differs for everyone. We recommend having one person to take the lead in instructing the rest of the participants on creating the poses based on the leader's vantage point so that the end result can be a coherent pattern of arms and faces. 

You can do this activity as a challenge in a teambuilding game like [minefield](/playbook/energizers/minefield/). Here are some suggested layouts from The Smart Local for you and your team to have fun in creating a whacky collage.
