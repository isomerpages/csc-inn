### Pass the Knot
*#facetoface #postprogram*

This is a tweak to conducting a reflection within learning circle. The addition of a rope adds a tactile feel to the process of reflection so that participants can focus better, so this is especially useful at the end of a long day at a workshop.

#### Instructions  
1. Prepare a length of rope that is long enough to accommodate all group members. Knot both ends of the rope to form a loop.   
2. All group members have to hold the rope with both hands.  
3. To add some excitement, play music in the background and tell participants to traverse the rope and pass the knot along.  
4. When the music stops, the person who gets the knot will share his/her reflection.
