### Learning at Lunch
*#virtual #preprogram*
<br/>

Working from home doesn't mean that you have to dine alone during lunch breaks. How about meeting up with some friends for a learning session over lunch? This teambuilding idea is similar to [Watch Parties](/playbook/teambuilding/watch-parties/) except that it involves more interactivity with a trainer who is conducting the learning session.

In fact, this is already happening in CSC where certain Chill Out Wednesdays take place during lunch time for colleagues to enjoy a time of bonding over a live cooking lesson for instance. Likewise, you can make this happen during lunch break as a pre-program activity before the afternoon's main learning program commences. You may even consider getting some of your willing participants to facilitate a Learning at Lunch session for their peers, provided that the materials required are readily available at home, of course.
