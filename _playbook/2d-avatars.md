### Avatars
*#virtual*

<br/>
Avatars can help participants in receiving feedback from a third partyâ€™s perspective. As avatars mask their true identities, participants may feel safe about giving feedback to each other. You may also consider printing their avatars on their certificates at the end of a program as a form of personalised gift.
