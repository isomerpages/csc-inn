### Secret Santa 
*#virtual #mainprogram*
<br/>

Pairing your learners together for collaborative learning has never been easier with online secret Santa generator platforms such as [Secret Santa Organizer](https://www.secretsantaorganizer.com/) and [Draw Names](https://www.drawnames.com/secret-santa-generator?step=3). While these platforms are conventionally used to facilitate gift exchanges during the Christmas season, they can also allow you to group your participants into pairs randomly with minimal effort.  

Here are some instances where Secret Santa generators can be used to facilitate collaborative learning:  
   * Exchange of peer feedback on individual assignments
   * Peer interviews  
   * 1-to-1 reflections  
   
With these tools, you can make learning more exciting as your learners anticipate receiving a random partner or assignment. You can focus on developing your program's content and facilitate your teach piece without fussing about this administrative chore.  All you need are your participants' names and email addresses. Read on to find out how these Secret Santa  generators work.
