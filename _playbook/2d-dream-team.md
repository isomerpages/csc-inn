The Dream Team at [Qualtrics](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/qualtrics-dream-team-bringing-events-back-individual-kortney-osborne/) specialises in fulfilling attendees' needs by delivering goods and services to them promptly so that they can focus better and be fully engaged in an event. A need could be a small request for coffee to keep awake or a sweater to keep warm during an event. The team actively listens to attendees' requests and then responds to delight them with surprise deliveries. This ultimately creates a positive impression that leaves attendees wanting to return for more of such events.  
  
Given that your project team may be leaner than Qualtrics' Dream Team, here's how you can run your scaled down version of a dream team.

### Step 1: Collate pre-orders before programme starts  
Create a Google Form to invite your participants to state their requests for items or services that can help them focus better in your programme. Do this at least three weeks before the start of your programme to allow sufficient buffer time to cater to their needs. 

Your Google Form should include the following fields:  
* Participant's name  
* Participant's address  
* Participant's contact number  
* Request -- This can be phrased along the line of 'If we could do anything for you during this programme, what would it be?'  

### Step 2: Deliver to fulfil participants' pre-orders  
If your programme is run as an online synchronous event, you'll need to arrange for postal delivery beforehand to fulfil your participants' requests. However, if your programme is run as a face-to-face event, you can arrange for the items to be ready at your venue and have a crew on standby to hand them to your participants during your programme.  
  
### Step 3: Prepare items for impromptu requests  
Monitor incoming requests throughout your programme to anticipate your participants' needs and stock up on high-demand items ahead of time.  
  
These are some items that you may foresee participants requesting for during your programme:  
* Portable smartphone chargers  
* Blankets    
* Coffee  
* Tea  
* Snacks

### What makes the Dream Team so impactful  
Kortney Osbourne's [article](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/qualtrics-dream-team-bringing-events-back-individual-kortney-osborne/) about the Dream Team summed up its mind-blowing impact on event organizers as follows:  
'Implementing real-time feedback channels can be daunting but there is incredible value in being customer obsessed and focusing on the attendee experience. From our personal experience, we can tell you that there is nothing better than being able to close the loop with our customers and make every experience an incredible one.'
