### Wheel of Names 
*#facetoface #virtual #preprogram #mainprogram #postprogram*

You have a full class of participants and you're asking for volunteers to perform a task such as a sharing a self-introduction, ideas for a class discussion, or a reflection to consolidate key learning outcomes. But no one is responding to you. 

With [Wheel of Names](https://wheelofnames.com/), you can delegate tasks to participants at random and no one will fault you for being biased towards a select few participants. To set this up, simply key in your participants' names in the text box and they will appear on an animated wheel. Then, click to spin the wheel and wait for the pointer to land on a name. To ensure transparency with your participants during a virtual lesson on Zoom, simply show the Wheel of Names via Zoom's **Share Screen** feature when spinning the wheel.
