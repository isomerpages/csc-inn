### Fly on the Wall
*#virtual #facetoface #postprogram*

Sometimes writing in the first person results in biased views as facts get exaggerated to cast ourselves in a better light. Try getting learners to reflect on their learning experiences from the point of view of a fly on the wall. If you feel that this is unsavoury, you can consider inanimate objects found in a typical classroom such as potted plants or security cameras. The purpose of doing this is to help them to frame their reflection as a third person recount.  

One benefit of writing in the third person perspective is that reflections can be more objective. A learner can be more honest with himself when reflecting about his high and low points in a workshop. 

The third person perspective also helps to expand the scope of our observations. Instead of just examining her own involvement, a learner can include observations about the surrounding characters and situations that have contributed to her learning experience.
