### Piing.Events
*#facetoface #virtual*

[Piing.Events](https://piing.events/) is a web-based multiplayer gaming service that currently offers four party games. Each game can last about 10 minutes or more, subject to your program's design. The capacity of the games ranges from 30 to 200 players.

To set up a game, you only need your computer to be connected to a big screen in your classroom and players will use their smartphones as controllers. For a virtual program run on Zoom, you can project the game's screen on Zoom's **Share Screen** feature. 

The price plans for each game are not revealed on [Piing.Events](https://piing.events/) but you can email them to enquire.
