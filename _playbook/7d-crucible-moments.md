### Crucible Moments
*#virtual #facetoface #preprogram #mainprogram #postprogram*

A crucible moment is a transformative experience through which an individual comes to an altered sense of identity. These are times when your character is tested by adversity and great strength is shown. They include significant events in life such as childbirth, milestones in education, or an overseas holiday experience. By framing a storytelling session in this context, it gives participants a clear perspective to learn from another personâ€™s struggles and accomplishments.

Engaging participants in conversations about their lives' crucible moments can be a great way for them to relate personally with each other as they share about their lives beyond their professioal circles. You will need to set up a safe environment for your participants to feel comfortable about sharing their personal stories. Here are some suggestions for you to do this: 
  **1. Set clear expectations.**   
     Some ground rules to set can include putting aside devices to remove distractions so that participants can practice active listening to honour each speaker, or simply reserving one's judgment of what is being shared. 
  **2. Lead by example.**   
     People are more likely to warm up to the idea of sharing their personal stories when the facilitator starts sharing first. This way, you can model the right behaviour for the rest of your participants to follow. This also helps to give them a clearer idea about what they can share about, and it is especially important since our memories are often riddled with so many events that we don't really know where to begin our sharing. 
  **3. Honour the speaker.**  
     More often than not, a person's story contains intimate details that resonate with her audience as they may have gone through similar experiences. Sometimes it is not easy for a person to step out of his comfort zone to share his personal story, especially if it involves a painful memory. The facilitator needs to honour the speaker for sharing about her crucible moments by affirming her experiences. For instance, you may say, 'Thank you for sharing your story. I would like to honour you for what you have just shared with us. I can tell that is has had an impact on several of us here as you have inspired us to...'
