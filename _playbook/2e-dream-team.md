### Dream Team 
*#facetoface #virtual*

Ask participants about what they envision a learning session to be like if it were to be organised by their dream team. For instance, you may ask ‘What would you like your first hour of training to be like?’ Then, you may design your program according to the preferences described by your participants.

This idea is inspired by the Qualtrics’ Dream Team. Click [here](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/qualtrics-dream-team-bringing-events-back-individual-kortney-osborne/) to read more.
