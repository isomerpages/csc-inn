### Peer Interview
*#virtual #facetoface #postprogram*

Letting learners interview each other about their learning experiences creates opportunities for them to practice active listening as they learn from each other to consolidate their learning for a workshop. If you intend to do this in a virtual program, simply move your participants into breakout rooms on Zoom. Having an assistant will prove to be helpful as several breakout rooms have to be created for participants to speak in pairs.  

Before you begin, make sure that you have a template of interview questions for learners to use. This will ensure that the learners' conversations are aligned to your workshop's learning objectives. Keep your questions open-ended so that learners are encouraged to elaborate on their answers. 

Here are some examples of open-ended questions:
   * Describe a job well done by a teammate. How has it inspired you?  
   * Describe how you have learned to overcome your limitations.  
   * Describe how you have tapped on your strengths to contribute to your group's objectives.
