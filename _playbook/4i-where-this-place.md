### Where's This Place?
*#virtual #facetoface #preprogram*

Getting to know each other's localities is a fantastic way to build relations as we find common interests in shared experiences and spaces. This game of 'Where's This Place?' is simply done with the street view function of Google Maps to show participants' community assets. Participants can easily submit images of their selected places instantly without having to leave home. There is not much preparatory work to be done since participants are not required to submit their images for you to collate before your program begins. 

The images can be posted on collaborative platforms such as [Padlet](https://padlet.com/). Participants need not log in, so the submissions can appear anonymous, which makes the game work even better (*see image above*). 

Here are some possible themes to explore for this game: 
   * Your neighbourhood  
   * Old school playgrounds of yesteryears  
   * Die die must try hawker fare 
   * Hipster cafes 
   * Iconic architecture
