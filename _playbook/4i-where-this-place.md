### Where's This Place?
*#virtual #facetoface #preprogram*

Getting to know each other's localities can be a fun way to build relations as we find common interests in shared experiences and spaces. This game of 'Where's This Place?' is  done simply with the street view function of Google Maps to show participants' community assets. Participants can easily submit images of their selected places instantly without having to leave home. There is not much preparatory work to be done since participants are not required to submit their images for you to collate before your program begins. 

The images can be posted on collaborative platforms such as [Padlet](https://padlet.com/). Participants need not log in with registered accounts, so the submissions can appear anonymous, which makes the game work even better (*see image above*). 

Here are some possible themes to explore for this game: 
   * Your neighbourhood  
   * Old school playgrounds of yesteryears  
   * Die-die must try hawker fare   
   * Hipster cafes   
   * Iconic architecture  
   
#### Instructions (Desktop Version)

1. The facilitator will have to prepare a collaborative platform for the submission of images. This example is based on [Padlet](https://padlet.com/). Remember to enable **comments** so that your participants can key in their answers to each image being shown. You can also enable **content filtering** to guard against the sharing of NSFW content.
