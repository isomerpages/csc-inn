### Call-a-Friend
*#virtual #mainprogram #postprogram*
<br/>

While moving participants into breakout rooms on Zoom seems ideal for small group reflections, it will inevitably cause some delays in a program as you will need some time to allocate breakout rooms to all participants. Here's an alternative for your consideration: Have your participants call each other to share their reflections in pairs while staying in the main meeting room. 

Pairing participants for this Call-a-Friend activity can be done easily with Secret Santa generators such as [Secret Santa Organizer](https://www.secretsantaorganizer.com/) or [Draw Names](https://www.drawnames.com/secret-santa-generator?step=3). You can check out our article [Secret Santa](/playbook/teambuilding/secret-santa/
) to find out more about using these tools. 

#### Instructions
1. After briefing your participants on the reflection activity, have them draw the names of their randomly assigned partners using a Secret Santa generator.  
2. Participants will use Zoom's private chat function to ask for their partners' contact numbers. This will save you the trouble of sharing the class contact list while respecting your participants' privacy.  
3. Prompt participants to mute their mics to avoid interrupting each other's conversations with their phone calls.  
4. Participants will ring up their partners to complete the reflections task.  
5. Once the phone calls are over, participants will put their phones away and flash a thumbs-up emoji to show that they're ready to proceed with the next part of the program.
