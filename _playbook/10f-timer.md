### Timer 
*#virtual #facetoface #preprogram #mainprogram #postprogram*

Use a large visible timer as a visual cue for presenters to keep to a time limit. This is simple to do with the Google Chrome web browser.

First, type your desired time limit in Google Chrome's search bar (E.g. 5 min timer). Then, you may select fullscreen mode to display the timer on your screen clearly for all participants to view. You should consider projecting your computer's display on a classroom wall or screen, and connect its audio to a set of speakers. The latter will ensure that the alarm is heard loud and clear when the countdown timer ends.
