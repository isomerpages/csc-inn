#### Suggested Layouts 
Here are some layouts for you to create your video.  

##### Side-by-Side: PowerPoint Slide + Background Image + Presenter  
![Layout 1](/images/Recording studio layout 1.jpg)  

**Things to note about this layout:**
   * Make sure that your slide is not filled with too many words.  
   * The content points should appear on the left or right side of each slide for optimal display.  
   * The presenter must be stationery.

**Things to note about this layout**  
   * Useful for hosting live talkshows on Zoom, Facebook Live and YouTube Live.  
   * Alternatively, interviews and discussions can be recorded before being sent to viewers.  
   * Ample rehearsals are required for recording begins.  
   * More content can be added to appear after the interview during the post-recording stage.

#### What to look out for from start to finish? 
##### Before Recording 
1. Have a storyboard! You can include your script, slide transitions and OBS layout.  
2. Decide if you would like to add in the slides/images post-recording or record directly with the slides/images in place.  
3. Have a crew ready! You will need at least 1 person to manage the recording for you using OBS.  
4. Do not wear green and donâ€™t use props that are green.  
5. Remove pieces of furniture and props that are redundant so that you video doesn't look cluttered.   
6. Check the studio lightings and ensure your face is well lit.  
7. Check for reflective surfaces that might cause uncomfortable glares in your video.  
8. Demarcate your movement area that will appear in your video.  
9. Make sure your PowerPoint slides, images and videos are ready for insertion.   
10. Do a 5-second sample recording to check that the video recording runs smoothly.  
11. Check that the sound can be heard clearly.  
12. Use a clicker if you wish to control the transition of your slides.  
13. Make sure that the video format (mkv/mp4) is acceptable on the digital platform where you will eventually upload your video.  

##### During Recording  
1. Don't apologize for mispronunciations. Your audience is not likely to notice occasional slip-ups but frequent apologies over mispronunciations will make your presentation seem incoherent.  
2. Speak as naturally as possible.  
3. Maintain eye contact with the camera. This will make you appear like you are engaging your audience who are viewing the video from remote locations.   
4. Avoid reading off the slides. This will give your viewers the impression that you're not prepared, so make sure that you read your script over and over again before recording to be familiar with it.  
5. Prepare a call sign for your assistant to cut and end the recording.  

##### After Recording  
Review the recording and edit it if required. At this stage, you may insert additional content like a summary of learning points if necessary. Once your video is ready, you may upload it onto a shared platform such as Learn DC.
