### Brainwriting
*#virtual #facetoface #mainprogram*

It's typical to see more dominant team members express their views in a brainstorm session while the more introspective members don't get heard as often. Brainwriting is your solution to this problem. 

Ideas are generated by giving team members some quiet time to write their ideas instead of discussing them verbally. As a moderator, you will have to set a time limit for the brainwriting and remind participants not to communicate verbally but only to communicate in writing. 

Brainwriting can be done on paper or on collaborative digital platforms such as [Jamboard](https://edu.google.com/products/jamboard/?modal_active=none) and [Miro](https://miro.com/).
