### Assign Buddies
*#facetoface #virtual*

<br>
Having a list of participants ready will be really helpful in organising them for collaborative work.

This can also help them to warm up to each other before a program starts. You may assign them on a simple task such as this: 'Have a discussion with your buddies about [state your topic] and post your ideas on [Padlet](https://padlet.com/ "Padlet's Homepage").'
