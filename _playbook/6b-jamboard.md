### Google Jamboard
*#virtual #mainprogram*
<br/>  
<br/>

Google Jamboard is a digital whiteboard that is a close cousin of Miro. You can access it for free with your Google account and share it with your teammates for collaborative work in ideation. As shown by the image above, collaborators create posts by adding sticky notes. The sticky notes can be shifted around the Jamboard page by any of the collaborators. With Jamboard we can hold discussions anywhere without the hassle of transferring physical copies of sticky notes between different venues. This is a huge plus especially in recent times when virtual meetings have become the new norm.

#### Advantages 
1. Google Jamboard can be shared with multiple collaborators as with any document from a shared Google drive.  
2. Collaborators can create as many pages as needed for a Jamboard project.  
3. Variety of interactions includes annotating with freehand writing, inserting images, text boxes, and posting sticky notes.  

#### Disadvantages  
1. A background image used for organising an ideation process cannot be locked, so it can be easily shifted or even deleted by any collaborator. 
2. All annotations and sticky notes can be deleted by anyone without prior permission, and there is no version history for past actions to be tracked.  
3. Each sticky note has a character limit, so notes must be kept concise.
