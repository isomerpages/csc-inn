### Hidden Surprises
*#facetoface #preprogram #mainprogram #postprogram*

Post-its are really handy as hidden notes scattered around your classroom. You may consider hiding designated persona or characters to be assigned to your participants for role playing. You can also do this when assigning themes for each team’s presentation.

Alternatively, assignments can be hidden in envelopes and issued randomly to different groups. The element of surprise can make learning experiences more exciting by heightening the participants’ anticipation of the next learning activity.
