In 2017, we conceptualised INN x CSC as a sandbox for innovation and experimentation, where public officers can come together to collaborate and try out new ideas. Our intent is to encourage you to adopt a ‘Dream big, test early and fail fast’ approach for challenges you may be facing in the public service, and to enable you to quickly iterate and create better, more timely solutions.

Launched in August 2018, INN x CSC occupies 1,400 sq m at the iconic Jurong Town Hall building. It is also a space for you to discover and learn through various learning interventions, such as engaging interactions with subject matter experts and interactive fringe activities.

INN x CSC embodies and aims to foster the following 5 traits in public officers:
